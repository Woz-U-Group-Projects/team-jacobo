//Firebase is a Backend As A Service or BAAS, meaning it is a NoSQL data store that is in the cloud that your clients can access directly in realtime.

//Now this means Firebase has itâ€™s own Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, Authentication, Hosting and many other services.

// The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud - hosted database.Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client.
