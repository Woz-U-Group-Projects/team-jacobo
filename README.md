Final Project

 

**Website App Idea:** 

Skill Tracker (Blog for now)

 

**What is it?** 

Will document progress of acquired skill sets (specific topics and concepts learned) for programmers and will automatically populate into a digital resume. User's skills will have specific tagged terminologies and concepts that have been mastered, separated by levels. Every time a user upgrades their skillset, a graph will show their progress. There will also be a Kahoots style app inside the website where user can "refresh" their vernacular. Users can also "test" out their skills by completing tasks to show user has mastered said topic. 

 

**What will this solve?**

This will be a tool to keep track and documentation of skills user has acquired over the time of learning said skills. 

 

**Technologies:**

FrontEnd: React

Backend: Node JS + Express

Database: NoSQL
